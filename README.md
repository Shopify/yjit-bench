yjit-bench
==========

Small set of benchmarks and scripts for the YJIT Ruby JIT compiler project, which lives in
the [Shopify/yjit](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit) repository.

The benchmarks are found in the `benchmarks` directory. Individual Ruby files
in `benchmarks` are microbenchmarks. Subdirectories under `benchmarks` are
larger macrobenchmarks. Each benchmark relies on a harness found in
[./harness/harness.rb](harness/harness.rb). The harness controls the number of times a benchmark is
run, and writes timing values into an output file.

The `run_benchmarks.rb` script (optional) traverses the `benchmarks` directory and
runs the benchmarks in there. It reads the
output file written by the benchmarking harness. The output is written to
multiple files at the end -- CSV, text and JSON -- so that results can be easily viewed or
graphed in any spreadsheet editor.

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench.git yjit-bench
```

### Benchmarking YJIT

yjit-bench supports benchmarking any Ruby implementation. But if you want to benchmark YJIT,
follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/yjit/yjit.md#building-yjit)
to build and install YJIT.

If you install it with the name `ruby-yjit` on [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby),
you should enable it before running `./run_benchmarks.rb`:

```
chruby ruby-yjit
```

## Usage

To run all the benchmarks and record the data:
```
cd yjit-bench
./run_benchmarks.rb
```

This runs for a few minutes and produces a table like this in the console (results below not up to date):
```

```

The `interp/yjit` column is the ratio of the average time taken by the interpreter over the
average time taken by YJIT after a number of warmup iterations. Results above 1 represent
speedups. For instance, 1.14 means "YJIT is 1.14 times as fast as the interpreter".

### Specific categories

By default, `run_benchmarks.rb` runs all three [benchmark categories](./benchmarks.yml),
`--category headline,other,micro`. You can run only benchmarks with specific categories:

```
./run_benchmarks.rb --category micro
```

You can also only the headline benchmarks with the `--headline` option:

```
./run_benchmarks.rb --headline
```

### Specific benchmarks

To run one or more specific benchmarks and record the data:
```
./run_benchmarks.rb fib lee optcarrot
```

### Running a single benchmark

This is the easiest way to run a single benchmark.
It requires no setup at all and assumes nothing about the Ruby you are benchmarking.
It's also convenient for profiling, debugging, etc, especially since all benchmarked code runs in that process.

```
ruby benchmarks/some_benchmark.rb
```

## Ruby options

By default, yjit-bench benchmarks the Ruby used for `run_benchmarks.rb`.
If the Ruby has `--yjit` option, it compares two Ruby commands, `-e "interp::ruby"` and `-e "yjit::ruby --yjit`.
However, if you specify `-e` yourself, you can override what Ruby is benchmarked.

```sh
# "xxx::" prefix can be used to specify a shorter name/alias, but it's optional.
./run_benchmarks.rb -e "ruby" -e "mjit::ruby --mjit"

# You could also measure only a single Ruby
./run_benchmarks.rb -e "3.1.0::/opt/rubies/3.1.0/bin/ruby"

# With --chruby, you can easily specify rubies managed by chruby
./run_benchmarks.rb --chruby "3.1.0" --chruby "3.1.0+YJIT::3.1.0 --yjit"

# ";" can be used to specify multiple executables in a single option
./run_benchmarks.rb --chruby "3.1.0;3.1.0+YJIT::3.1.0 --yjit"
```

### YJIT options

You can use `--yjit_opts` to specify YJIT command-line options:

```
./run_benchmarks.rb --yjit_opts="--yjit-version-limit=10" fib lee optcarrot
```

### Running pre-init code

It is possible to use `run_benchmarks.rb` to run arbitrary code before
each benchmark run using the `--with-pre-init` option.

For example: to run benchmarks with `GC.auto_compact` enabled a
`pre-init.rb` file can be created, containing `GC.auto_compact=true`,
and this can be passed into the benchmarks in the following way:

```
./run_benchmarks.rb --with-pre-init=./pre-init.rb
```

This file will then be passed to the underlying Ruby interpreter with
`-r`.

## Harnesses

You can find several test harnesses in this repository:

* harness - the normal default harness, with duration controlled by warmup iterations and time/count limits
* harness-perf - a simplified harness that runs for exactly the hinted number of iterations
* harness-bips - a harness that measures iterations/second until stable
* harness-continuous - a harness that adjusts the batch sizes of iterations to run in stable iteration size batches
* harness-stats - count method calls and loop iterations
* harness-warmup - a harness which runs as long as needed to find warmed up (peak) performance

To use it, run a benchmark script directly, specifying a harness directory with `-I`:

```
ruby -Iharness benchmarks/railsbench/benchmark.rb
```

There is also a robust but complex CI harness in [the yjit-metrics repo](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-metrics).

### Iterations and duration

With the default harness, the number of iterations and duration
can be controlled by the following environment variables:

* `WARMUP_ITRS`: The number of warm-up iterations, ignored in the final comparison (default: 15)
* `MIN_BENCH_ITRS`: The minimum number of benchmark iterations (default: 10)
* `MIN_BENCH_TIME`: The minimum seconds for benchmark (default: 10)

There is a handy script for running benchmarks just once using
`WARMUP_ITRS=0 MIN_BENCH_ITRS=1 MIN_BENCH_TIME=0`, for example
with the `--yjit-stats` command-line option:

```
./run_once.sh --yjit-stats benchmarks/railsbench/benchmark.rb
```

### Using perf

There is also a harness to run benchmarks for a fixed
number of iterations, for example to use with the `perf stat` tool:

```
ruby --yjit-stats -I./harness-perf benchmarks/lee/benchmark.rb
```

This is the only harness that uses `run_benchmark`'s argument, `num_itrs_hint`.

## Measuring memory usage

`--rss` option of `run_benchmarks.rb` allows you to measure RSS after benchmark iterations.

```
./run_benchmarks.rb --rss
```

## Rendering a graph

`--graph` option of `run_benchmarks.rb` allows you to render benchmark results as a graph.

```bash
# Write a graph at data/output_XXX.png (it will print the path)
./run_benchmarks.rb --graph
```

### Installation

Before using this option, you might need to install the dependencies of [Gruff](https://github.com/topfunky/gruff):

```bash
# macOS
brew install imagemagick

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
```

### Changing font size

You can regenerate a graph with `misc/graph.rb`, changing its font size.

```
Usage: misc/graph.rb [options] CSV_PATH
        --title SIZE                 title font size
        --legend SIZE                legend font size
        --marker SIZE                marker font size
```

## Disabling CPU Frequency Scaling

To disable CPU frequency scaling with an Intel CPU, edit `/etc/default/grub` or `/etc/default/grub.d/50-cloudimg-settings.cfg` and add `intel_pstate=no_hwp` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Itâ€™s a space-separated list.

Then:
```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo'
```

To verify things worked:
 - `cat /proc/cmdline` to see the `intel_pstate=no_hwp` parameter is in there
 - `ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/` and `hwp_dynamic_boost` should not exist
 - `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo` should say `1`
