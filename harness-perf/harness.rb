# This is a relatively minimal harness meant for use with Linux perf(1).
# Example usage:
#
#    $ PERF='record -e cycles' ruby -Iharness-perf benchmarks/fib.rb
#
# When recording with perf(1), make sure the benchmark runs long enough; you
# can tweak the MIN_BENCH_ITRS environment variable to lengthen the run. A race
# condition is possible where the benchmark finishes before the perf(1)
# subprocess has a chance to attach, in which case perf outputs no profile.

# Run $WARMUP_ITRS or 10 iterations of a given block. Then run $MIN_BENCH_ITRS
# or `num_itrs_int` iterations of the block, attaching a perf command to the
# benchmark process.
#
# `num_itrs_hint` should be close to what the default harness would use as
# the number of benchmark iterations. For example, if the default harness runs
# 10 benchmark iterations (after 15 warmup iterations) for a benchmark with
# the default MIN_BENCH_TIME, the benchmark should have 10 as `num_itrs_hint`.
