We'd love your contributions! Folks have contributed new benchmarks, new test harnesses
and more. I'm sure there's more you'd like to see in yjit-bench.

If you have questions or problems getting set up, you're probably not the only
one with difficulties. You can [file an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench/issues)
and we'll answer as soon as we can.

We welcome [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench/pulls) in 
the usual way, though you'll need to sign a Shopify
Contributor License Agreement - when you file the PR a bot should direct you through
the process.

If you're looking for something to do, the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench/issues)
can also be helpful.

Right now documentation is mostly in the benchmark files and in the README.
A PR can be a great way to correct or expand that documentation. If you
see a problem, file an issue or open a PR!
